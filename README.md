In these two small programs, I wanted to calculate the insurance months and days an employee has accumulated. 
In the first one, I'm converting 25-day months to 30-day months.

The second program has three options (25 days, 25 days converted to 30, 30 days). 
In the second one, I tried to do something with Python UI and Tkinter.
